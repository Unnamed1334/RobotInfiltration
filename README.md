# Robot Infiltration

A game made for Ludum Dare 44 in July 2017. Made as part of a team of 2.

A top down shooter where you can shut down robots by disable there power.

I like how the systems interacted. The AI of the enemy isn't that complicated but giving the player a secondary way to fight the enemy resulted in the AI mattering more. It is still a very simple game with only a single level.
